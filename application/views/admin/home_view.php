            <p>
                <strong>DOST-XI Document Tracking System</strong> is a web portal used to store, manage and track
                electronic documents and electronic images of paper based information.

            <p>
                Each document is assigned to specific users. The system then creates a unique chat session for the
                document and only those users assigned to it are included in the chat group.
                Each user has it's own designation and have specific privileges depending on the type of user. All
                users can edit their own profile.
